# Data-mining-project

I did this project with guidance of my major (Politics) professor. <br>
It was to find out if the speech and the action of differenct provinces align, by analysis the policy addresses (Speech) and compare with the GDP spending (Action).<br>
My job was to collect the data, do data cleansing and identify them by catigories.<br>
I made the suggestion to my professor that we can find out the top words easily with the help of R.<br>
1) I downloaded the data and group them by provices. (folder /area)<br>
2) I splited them by sentences and years respectively.<br>
3) I ran the R script and found the top words from difference categories.<br>

There are many places can be improved, but I still upload the original files here as a record :)
